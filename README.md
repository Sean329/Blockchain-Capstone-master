# Decentralized Real Estate Marketplace

Final Project for Blockchain NanoDegree that requires to mint own tokens to represent the title to the properties. Before minting the token, the owner needs to verify she/she owns the property. A zk-SNARKs (zoKrates) mechanism will be used to create a verification system which can prove the ownership of title to the property without revealing that specific information on the property. Once the token has been verified it will be placed on a blockchain market place (OpenSea) for others to purchase.
